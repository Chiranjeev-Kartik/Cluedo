# Cluedo
Cluedo is a python-based game inspired from a classic board game 'Cluedo'.

Hey there, To play Cluedo successfully you need to run the Cluedo.py file on your computer. The program will ask you to choose from a offline server and online server, So if you want to play the game with friends on different computers choose online server else offline server. If you choose online server, the program will give you a IP address that you need to share with your friends to join the game. (Make sure everyone is connected to the server machine through LAN/Hotspot.)

All players are required to have Client.py file on their machine. To join the game, players are required to update the host variable in Client.py with the IP address provided by Cluedo.py while setting up the game server.

After setting up the server, sharing the IP address with players, and updating the host variable you are all set to play the game. Enjoy!

Version 2.10.0 ( Introduction of Bot )
You can also deploy bots in game ( maximum 6 bots ). Simply run AwareBot.py (don't forget to update 'ip_address' variable in last with the ip address given by server at the time of setting up game). The Bots are capable enough to play the whole game by themselves.
